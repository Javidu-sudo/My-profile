My Hobby is coding because you can make lots of apps and games so people from all around the world can use it.When you are coding you can make buttons,text inputs and labels to make them do something when one of the buttons are clicked, you can do maybe do anything when you are coding. when you're using a software to code. <br>When you are coding you can make websites,apps or games even health apps or many more.There are lots of software out there for coding like thunkable,brackets and code.org and many more.<br>Why I like to code is because I am taking coding lessons (whitehatjr.com) in how to make websites and apps and many more.
